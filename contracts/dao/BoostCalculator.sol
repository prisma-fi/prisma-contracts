    @title Prisma Boost Calculator
    @notice "Boost" refers to a bonus to claimable PRISMA tokens that an account
            receives based on it's locked PRISMA weight. An account with "Max boost"
            is earning PRISMA rewards at 2x the rate of an account that is unboosted.
            Boost works as follows:

            * In a given week, the percentage of the weekly PRISMA rewards that an
            account can claim with maximum boost is the same as the percentage
            of PRISMA lock weight that the account has, relative to the total lock
            weight.
            * Once an account's weekly claims exceed the amount allowed with max boost,
            the boost rate decays linearly from 2x to 1x. This decay occurs over the same
            amount of tokens that were available for maximum boost.
            * Once an account's weekly claims are more than double the amount allowed for
            max boost, the boost bonus is fully depleted.
            * At the start of the next week, boost amounts are recalculated.

            As an example:

            * At the end of week 1, Alice has a lock weight of 100. There is a total
              lock weight of 1,000. Alice controls 10% of the total lock weight.
            * During week 2, a total of 500,000 new PRISMA rewards are made available
            * Because Alice has 10% of the lock weight in week 1, during week 2 she
              can claim up to 10% of the rewards (50,000 PRISMA) with her full boost.
            * Once Alice's weekly claim exceeds 50,000 PRISMA, her boost decays linearly
              as she claims another 50,000 PRISMA.
            * Once Alice's weekly claims exceed 100,000 PRISMA, any further claims are
              "unboosted" and receive only half as many tokens as they would have boosted.
            * At the start of the next week, Alice's boost is fully replenished. She still
              controls 10% of the total lock weight, so she can claim another 10% of this
              week's emissions at full boost.

            Note that boost is applied at the time of claiming a reward, not at the time
            the reward was earned. An account that has depleted it's boost may opt to wait
            for the start of the next week in order to claim with a larger boost.

            On a technical level, we consider the full earned reward to be the maximum
            boosted amount. "Unboosted" is more accurately described as "paying a 50%
            penalty". Rewards that go undistributed due to claims with lowered boost
            are returned to the unallocated token supply, and distributed again in the
            emissions of future weeks.
